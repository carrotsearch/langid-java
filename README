langid-java
-----------

A somewhat changed Java port of langid.py (https://github.com/saffsd/langid.py)

Usage
-----

Fetch a JAR from Maven repositories (or compile it yourself). Then check out
the javadocs of ILangIdClassifier and LangIdV3.

Memory and Speed
----------------

Don't get fooled by the size of the JAR archive. The data model is LZMA 
compressed and will take about ~10MB of RAM. Speed wise this implementation
should be faster than anything else out there; if you have very large texts
you can sub-sample, append those fragments and classify without processing
the entire content.

Quality
-------

At the moment the detection/ performance quality is identical to langid.py
(the model and the math code is identical, even if written in a slightly
different way to speed up computations in Java).
