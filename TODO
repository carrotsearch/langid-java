- the identifier should perform some kind of sanity normalization 
  (URLs, e-mail addresses, numbers?, most punctuation perhaps)? 

- should we identify ranges of unicode blocks (so that an English 
  text with a Japanese quotation doesn't mix up two profiles)?

- should we try to identify high-probability languages first?

- a hierarchical classifier (language groups, then a second round for languages which are very similar)?

- an automaton for top-K words for each language for *very* short texts?
